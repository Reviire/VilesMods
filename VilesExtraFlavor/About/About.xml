This is a simple mod that adds new versions of existing apparel, currently just medieval. The stats are identical, but the names are slightly different, such as "bonnet" and "bonnet, brimmed", and the textures are alterled slightly for flavor.

"Why?" you ask. 

Simple. When I play I like to make color-coordinated loadouts. But there aren't enough apparel pieces to make that feasible, at least early game. So this way, I can dress my builders in orange leather tunics, and my farmers in green hemp tunics.

That's all.</description>
