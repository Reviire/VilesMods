		<description>Dye and lightly sand corrected-grain leather. Nubuck is considered "good" quality leather compared to "excellent" quality full-grain leather. It's gently sanded to have a suede-like finish, but since it's not coated, it breathes better than other corrected-grain treatments and is quite attractive.</description>
